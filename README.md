Our multiple object tracking method is reliable to deal with occlusions, irregular object
motions, changing appearances by postponing the decision of object trajectories until sufficient
information is accumulated over time. It makes a global decision. The most possible hypothesis
generates the multiple objects tracking result. The trajectories provide information of object
identifications, motion histories, timing and object interactions. The information can be applied to
detect abnormal behaviors in video surveillance and collect traffic data in traffic control systems
